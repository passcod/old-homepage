After a bit less than a day after installing [Collusion][1], I spent a bit
untangling the nodes and took a screenshot. Here is my one day of web
connections:

[![Connection graph for website visits in one day](/images/blog/DLXYs.png)](http://imgur.com/DLXYs)

You can clearly see the central websites: [Facebook][2] (even though I do not
use it anymore, its presence is everywhere), [Twitter][3], and [Google][4].
Worth noting is that these three sites are not connected. [Tumblr][5],
[Wordpress][6], and [Mozilla][7] are also close by. I use Tumblr (for work) and
Mozilla (for joy) a lot, but I was quite surprised to see Wordpress there.
Turns out reading a single article connected it (and me!) to 8 other websites.

[Changery][8] is the blank one to the right of Mozilla. You can see it’s pretty
well connected, even though there’s not much on there. I would have expected
[GitHub][9] and [Gravatar][10] to be more connected, but maybe it’s better that
way. The one hidden above [StackOverflow][11] is [askubuntu.com][12]. It’s
kinda weird that it’s not connected to [ubuntu.com][13], which is the blank one
to the right of [Foursquare][14] with three links.

[Wikipedia][15] is completely disconnected, which is OK given I haven’t visited
it today. The one linked to it is [Yarp][16], which I briefly visited to get
the doc for their [Timeago jQuery plugin][17]. [Ars Technica][18] is quite
strongly surrounded, hmph.

The original purpose of Collusion being to see who tracks you, let’s give a
special mention to QuantServe, who is the most linked reddie here.

This picture is very interesting. There’s definitely much more that can be said
about it, more analysis, etc. Also, the way things grouped themselves (even if
I have influenced it to make the overall picture clearer) is revealing of what
websites are the core of my web experience, and which are not, esp. regarding
which I have pinned as App Tabs, and which I have not. Thank [@toolness][19]!
