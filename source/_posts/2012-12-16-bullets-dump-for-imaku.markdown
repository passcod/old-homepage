 - White to be the dominant colour, not black as in every other thing out there.
 - Simple design, flat feel. Most others try to bring depth, but maybe trying too hard…
 - Icon grid is overrated. Text is nice too.
 - For non-phone devices (desktops / laptop / tablets / hybrids), the keyboard is accessible:
   * Alfred / Gnome3 -style type to search and launch
   * Maybe bring back Ubiquity principles?
 - Modifiers for touch screens:
   * Hold one corner == Control / Alt / Super keys
 - Use touchpads fully: gestures, etc – not just left/right click simulation
 - Forget the past:
   * DON'T BE BACKWARD COMPATIBLE !!!
   * Menu bar? Pfff.
   * Docks? No need.
   * Window decorations? Nope: can use modifier keys to manipulate windows (resize, move) and gestures / hotkeys to close them.
 - But learn from it:
   * DON'T FORGET POWER USERS !!!
   * Ease of manipulating windows in bulk (tiling, layouts)
   * Settings, options, customisability.
   * In fact, educate users through "forced-learning" (like what is used in games, e.g. Meat Boy) so everyone's a power user.
   * Forget apps: applications are programs, we should make them simpler, not dumb.
   * PIPES !!! Pipes in Unix are the best thing ever, why couldn't we have something similar?
 - Rich command line, like Firefox's Dev Tools and Ace's control line
   * Make it an integral part of the system, not just something for geeks
 - Infinite desktop space:
   * No separate desktops / workspaces
   * The screen is a viewport onto the virtual desktop area.
   * Can save viewpoints to have quick-access
   * Base operation is 2D-only, but can lapse into the Z if user can handle the additional cognitive load ;)
   * Can do the usual, and pin windows to viewport
   * Super-advanced features:
      + Multiple screens have multiple viewports
      + Can connect different user spaces in one large canvas
      + A bit like multi-player tmux but for the desktop / GUI
