Yesterday was the dawn of a new, Octopress-powered website.
Today we've got SSL on several websites, including:

 - <https://passcod.net>
 - <https://words.passcod.net>
 - <https://dash.passcod.net>
 - <https://roccoliphic.passcod.net>
 - <https://stuff.passcod.net> (not 100% sure for this one)
 - <https://fonts.passcod.net>

Even if these are all HTTPS for the first request,
they're probably not fully-SSL, except for this
website (I made sure of that), which now proudly
sports a lil padlock:
