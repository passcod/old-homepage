This is the license under which my code and content, here and everywhere else, is published
under by default:

> All text and code and bytes and images that I have and will author, baring any contrary notice on
> or joined to the work in question, or a global notice published here on __passcod.net__
> (which would apply to all future works &mdash; one cannot, after all, un-release something), is hereby
> released in the Public Domain, or licensed under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
> or [the Unlicense](http://unlicense.org), whichever gives __you__ the most rights.

Now, *what does it mean*?

 - Most of my significant work already has an attached notice, and thus is governed by that notice,
   not by the blurb above.

 - Every new project/repo that doesn't have a license notice is released in the Public Domain by default.

 - Most of my gists and code snippets out and about on the web are now released in the Public Domain.

 - All the content I have written, and will write, here (on this site/blog) is released in the Public Domain.
 
 - Whatever I have written to websites (e.g. Facebook, StackOverflow, Wikipedia, Twitter…) that have T&Cs
   which regulate the ownership and licensing of content is not affected by the above.

 - If I later say so, all *future* work can be licensed again (not released in the PD), but not *past*
   work (that are released now and forever).
 
 - Octopress (on which this website runs) is MIT licensed (and remains so), but all code I have added to it
   is Public Domain (i.e. if you run a diff between the master branch of this repo and the octopress
   main repo, you should get only code I have authored, and thus code that is released. Although that's not
   an exact procedure. But you get the meaning).

 - When I contribute to open source projects, my code and content is governed by whatever license that
   project uses.

 - When I write code for work (i.e. commercial), it is governed (and owned) by that company.
   So: no worries, boss! :)
