I have to say, I’m a sucker for pay-as-you-go, so PubNub immediately appealed
more than Pusher. But what made me really choose is Socket.IO integration. That
I can write a Javascript app using Socket.IO with a prototyping backend in
Node.JS, then switch to a more robust Ruby on Heroku platform for beta &
publication seamlessly is awesome.

So, PubNub, here I come! (But I’ll keep Pusher there, just in case :)

custom solutions, too.
