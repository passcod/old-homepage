Félix Saparelli  
me@passcod.net

I am __@passcod__ on [Twitter],
[GitHub] and around the wider web.


If you have a comment or query
about this site or my work, use
the Disqus comments on the page
or send me a tweet.  
If you want to reach me privately,
shoot me an email. Twitter private
messages tend to stay _unread_ for
a while…  
If you wish to contact me for work,
send me an email and include all the
information you can. Emails merely
only asking if I am available will
be ignored: I can busy myself just
fine so make it interesting.
