  <div class="entry-content"><p>About 3 weeks ago I tried to reboot <a href="https://passcod.name/DynWorker">DynWorker</a>, my library
to “make web threading fun.” I wanted not only to take advantage
of newer technology, but also to give it a good layer of fresh
paint. I started by manually translating it all in CoffeeScript.</p>

<p>And it was looking good! The straight conversion worked, so I made
a tiny change and tried to use a data:URI to load the worker code.
Which turned out to be impossible. I essentially wanted to take the
entire library, stringify it, base64-encode it, and put it in a
variable… preferably at run-time. Y’know, so I didn&#8217;t have to dupe
my entire code in the source!</p>

<p>One of the best (!) solutions I found went like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>JS in Coffee, ah-yup</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="s">}())&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="nx">src</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Don’t do that, kids.</em></p>

<p>Besides, I had looked at the list of features I had to test, the list
of features I had thought of, the list of features I probably needed
to implement, and daaamn, boy, ah wasn’ gonna be done with it sooner.
So I tanked it.</p>

<p>Instead, I created <a href="https://github.com/passcod/libworker.js">libworker.js</a>. DynWorker has a line in the readme
saying it pretty low-level. That ain’t true no more. Libworker.js is to
DynWorker what Assembly is to C++ : a completely different level.</p>

<p>Here is the entirety of the source. You can take that and paste
it in your console and it’ll work. Promise.</p>

<p>(It’s actually <a href="https://github.com/passcod/libworker.js/blob/master/libworker.coffee">written in CoffeeScript</a>, don’t you worry, this
is not the source source, it’s not completely unmantainable. Although
I actually “hand-compile” this thing.)</p>

<p>If you can’t read minified JavaScript, there’s <a href="https://passcod.name/libworker.js">a page with examples</a>
available, albeit quite short. I just can’t justify too many words on this
little code!</p>

<p>This library can be included directly in any project that needs to use
WebWorkers, like <strong>Dyno.js</strong>, my upcoming Actor framework for browsers,
for which there is little source available in very non-obvious places.<br/>
You’ll just have to wait ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, <a href="/2013/01/04/on-ifttt-not-having-an-api-and-on-dot-thesides-v1.html">IFTTT sucks</a>. Turns out there&#8217;s a better IFTTT out there
called <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> that has a really easy to use developer interface.
Hence, I created a Zapier service for <strong>On the sides</strong>. Due to my own
UI not being great, though, you&#8217;ll have to fiddle around with cURL (or
better, <a href="http://httpie.org/">httpie</a>, which is what I&#8217;ll be using below) to make it all
work.</p>

<h2>Pre-reqs</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>You&#8217;ll need a Zapier account. This takes about 20 seconds to create, email
verification isn&#8217;t even necessary, and they&#8217;ve got a decent free plan.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#8217;ll need to log in to <a href="https://login.persona.org/">Mozilla Persona</a>. You can actually do that
later on when signing in to <strong>On the sides</strong>, but if emails take a bit of
time to arrive you might want to do it now if you have never done it before.
If you&#8217;re just playing around, use <code>some-word@mockmyid.com</code> instead when
doing the Mozilla Persona thing (but only there!).</p></li>
<li><p>You&#8217;ll need something to consume HTTP APIs with ease. I&#8217;ll use httpie, as
mentioned above, or you can use cURL, or a JS console with jQuery.ajax or
anything else that floats your boat. Whatever. It needs to be able to do
GET and POST (with PUT and DELETE as bonuses), and set custom headers.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#8217;ll need to know how to open the JS console. I won&#8217;t tell you how, just
figure it out and if you can&#8217;t, well, you probably can&#8217;t do the rest anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#8217;ll need about 15 minutes. More if you&#8217;re slow. Less if you&#8217;re da baws.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been reading articles by <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> recently, and here&#8217;s
one that struck me could also refer to open-source software:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/the-simple-truth">A shepherd builds a counting system</a> that works by throwing a pebble
into a bucket whenever a sheep leaves the fold, and taking a pebble
out whenever a sheep returns.  If you, the apprentice, do not understand
this system—if it is magic that works for no apparent reason—then
you will not know what to do if you accidentally drop an extra pebble
into the bucket.  That which you cannot make yourself, you cannot
remake when the situation calls for it.  You cannot go back to the
source, tweak one of the parameter settings, and regenerate the output,
without the source.  If &#8220;Two plus four equals six&#8221; is a brute fact unto
you, and then one of the elements changes to &#8220;five&#8221;, how are you to
know that &#8220;two plus five equals seven&#8221; when you were simply told that
&#8220;two plus four equals six&#8221;?</p>

<p>If you see a small plant that drops a seed whenever a bird passes it,
it will not occur to you that you can use this plant to partially
automate the sheep-counter.  Though you learned something that the
original maker would use to improve on his invention, you can&#8217;t go back
to the source and re-create it.</p>

<p><em>(from <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/la/truly_part_of_you/">Less Wrong&#8217;s “Truly Part of You”</a>)</em></p></blockquote>

<p>However, simply <em>using</em> open-source software does not give you an understanding
of its workings. It does not demystify it, it does not alleviate the <em>magic</em>
of the thing. In computer science especially, there is this concept of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">leaky
abstractions</a>: these are most flagrant and disturbing when one has no or
little understanding of the abstracted layer.</p>

<p>This is why I make a point of reading through at least part of the source of
every program and library I work with on a regular basis. I have read a bit
of the Linux kernel, a small chunk of the Firefox OS UI, most of Sinatra but
much less of Rails, I have debugged and contributed to one of my systems&#8217;
package manager, and just this afternoon I trudged through a Gem to insert
a debug statement and peek within an HTTPS request.</p>

<p>All these experiences provided me with knowledge I could never get just by
reading documentation. This knowledge allows me the incredible power of
remixing various bits into new solutions. What&#8217;s more, even though I have
cursed a bunch of developers while attempting to parse their witty one-liners,
I can hopefully learn from their mistakes and not just mine. Hmmm… <em>hopefully</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> is cool. It&#8217;s a nitfy little service that glues various
services together, pipe-style, and makes the realtime web just that
much more useful. Only, I thought they&#8217;d have the decency of including
HTTP triggers and channels so we could do whatever we damn well wanted
instead of being stuck with the handful of services we&#8217;re actually using.</p>

<p>So I need something to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trigger an IFTTT recipe,</li>
<li>get triggered by a recipe,</li>
<li>and be able to send and receive arbitrary data through that.</li>
</ul>


<p>My first thought was: let&#8217;s create a service that translates HTTP calls
to something IFTTT can handle and vice-versa. Woo! Boo! Not so easy.
Here are a few options:</p>

<h2>Email</h2>

<p>Possibly the easiest one to work with, albeit with a few serious caveats.
You can send emails to trigger@ifttt.com and it can also send you emails
as actions. The data is free-form and not really length-limited, and you
can even send a file through for binary data support.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, IFTTT only supports a single email channel per account, so
that means you&#8217;d have to give up on the email channel for other purposes.
(This ain&#8217;t so bad: you could always plug the HTTP calls into a 3rd-party
email service.)</p>

<h2>Feed</h2>

<p><em>Trigger only</em></p>

<p>Probably the best solution for triggers, this has the same advantages as email
minus the file attachment, but with better-structured data (more fields).</p>

<h2>Gmail</h2>

<p>Like email, but a bit better. Notably, you can send an email from your Gmail
account as an action, and trigger a recipe when a new email arrives, optionally
tagged. This could be a bit nicer as it allows you to still use both Email and
Gmail as channels. However, if you&#8217;ve got a Gmail account linked to IFTTT, there&#8217;s
no reason to use Email at all except for proxying things through as shown above.</p>

<li>White to be the dominant colour, not black as in every other thing out there.</li>
<li>Simple design, flat feel. Most others try to bring depth, but maybe trying too hard…</li>
<li>Icon grid is overrated. Text is nice too.</li>
<li>For non-phone devices (desktops / laptop / tablets / hybrids), the keyboard is accessible:

<li>Alfred / Gnome3 -style type to search and launch</li>
<li>Maybe bring back Ubiquity principles?</li>

<li>Modifiers for touch screens:

<li>But learn from it:

<li>DON&#8217;T FORGET POWER USERS !!!</li>
<li>Ease of manipulating windows in bulk (tiling, layouts)</li>
<li>Settings, options, customisability.</li>
<li>In fact, educate users through &#8220;forced-learning&#8221; (like what is used in games, e.g. Meat Boy) so everyone&#8217;s a power user.</li>
<li>Forget apps: applications are programs, we should make them simpler, not dumb.</li>
<li>PIPES !!! Pipes in Unix are the best thing ever, why couldn&#8217;t we have something similar?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rich command line, like Firefox&#8217;s Dev Tools and Ace&#8217;s control line

<ul>
<li>Make it an integral part of the system, not just something for geeks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Infinite desktop space:

<ul>
<li>No separate desktops / workspaces</li>
<li>The screen is a viewport onto the virtual desktop area.</li>
<li>Can save viewpoints to have quick-access</li>
<li>Base operation is 2D-only, but can lapse into the Z if user can handle the additional cognitive load ;)</li>
<li>Can do the usual, and pin windows to viewport</li>
<li>Super-advanced features:

<ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday was the dawn of a new, Octopress-powered website.
Today we&#8217;ve got SSL on several websites, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://passcod.net">https://passcod.net</a></li>
<li><a href="https://words.passcod.net">https://words.passcod.net</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dash.passcod.net">https://dash.passcod.net</a></li>
<li><a href="https://roccoliphic.passcod.net">https://roccoliphic.passcod.net</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stuff.passcod.net">https://stuff.passcod.net</a> (not 100% sure for this one)</li>
<li><a href="https://fonts.passcod.net">https://fonts.passcod.net</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Even if these are all HTTPS for the first request,
they&#8217;re probably not fully-SSL, except for this
website (I made sure of that), which now proudly
sports a lil padlock:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My latest open source project is <a href="//plong.me">Plong.me</a>, a zero-setup
file transfer app. I say file <em>transfer</em> and not file <em>sharing</em> because
no data is ever stored in &#8220;the cloud&#8221; or on a computer other than the ones
it is transfered between.</p>

<p>I wanted this to be zero-setup and require no download, no installation, no
sign up, no plugins, no nothing. Just a modern browser. I also wanted it to
be secure (read: end-to-end encryption) yet easy enough for anyone to use.
Daunting task.</p>

<p>This called for a peer-to-peer protocol, but the other requirements meant it
had to be a web p2p protocol available right now in browsers. This doesn&#8217;t
exist yet. <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/webrtc.html#peer-to-peer-data-api">WebRTC</a>
is getting there, but this part of it isn&#8217;t implemented anywhere yet. I therefore
had to make my own.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been saying that to friends, family, and colleagues for a while now,
and I think maybe I should just write it down and refer to it instead of
rehashing it every time. In the last few dozen explanations, it hasn&#8217;t
actually changed, so I think it&#8217;s pretty stable. Of course, the community
will have something to say, and that&#8217;s expected!</p></blockquote>

<p>There are more or less seven states to a new (software) project:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Figment</strong>. That&#8217;s when it&#8217;s just an idea, and maybe you&#8217;ve written
something down on a paper napkin, or discussed it over coffee with a friend.</li>
<li><strong>Planning</strong>. You&#8217;re actually putting more thought into it, doing the initial
research, hopefully consolidating the idea into something manageable.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype</strong>. Not necessarily code. Sometimes a prototype can just be rectangles
of paper under magnets on a whiteboard, and a few arrows here and there to represent
dynamics. Also known (in the case of code) as <strong>pre-alpha</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha</strong>. Finally! Code. You&#8217;ve probably pulled a directory structure out of thin air
and the code doesn&#8217;t actually do anything remotely productive yet.</li>
<li><strong>Beta</strong>. The project has most of its original main features completed, even though
there&#8217;s still a lot of bugs. You&#8217;ve taken features out of the codebase and told yourself
you&#8217;ll implement them later.</li>
<li><strong>Stable</strong>. The project has gotten enough XP and evolves into a product. There&#8217;s still
bugs and quirks, but the main features are there and you can finally release it to the
wider public (although if you&#8217;re open-source, this is more likely to happen on 4 or 5).</li>
<li><strong>Future</strong>. This is rumored to be the hardest part of the journey. This has two parts:
provide support for the now-released product, and continue development on new &amp; more
advanced features.</li>
</ol>


<p>These are general states. You might find that 1-3 can be collapsed, or that there&#8217;s a bunch
of extras in-between 6 and 7. You might also not agree on some of the descriptions I&#8217;ve given.
That&#8217;s fine. What&#8217;s important is the actual rule:</p>

<h3>When going from one state to the other, there is an 80% loss rate.</h3>

<p>In other words, for every 1000 things I&#8217;ve thought of, 200 got to be planned, 40 were prototyped,
8 made it to alpha, and 1.6 got to beta. I&#8217;ve had exactly one project reach state 7, and it&#8217;s discontinued.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Original on <a href="http://checkthis.com/biye">Checkthis.com</a>.</em></p>

<p>In the world of ruby, there exists this framework called Rails, which I&#8217;m
sure you&#8217;ve heard about. I happen not to like it very much. One of the
reasons is that I&#8217;ve read maybe 2% of Rails&#8217; code, whereas for most of the
other gems I use this is more like 40%. With Rails, I rely on magic (and,
yea, it&#8217;s nice) and with the other stuff, I rely on my own knowledge. I
prefer the latter.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also that Rails is an MVC framework, which is best buds with
ActiveRecord and is a pain to manage as soon as you separate them. If you
don&#8217;t want or need the MVC pattern, or ActiveRecord, you&#8217;re in for trouble.
If you are unfortunate enough to need a gem which is incompatible with a Rails
component, even if said component is supposed to be optional, you have my sympathies.</p>

<p>In the world of Ruby, there also exists a little wonder called Sinatra. Sinatra
is just the dispatcher part of Rails, plus the templating, plus a few other nifty
features, but done right. It&#8217;s small, sharp, lean, and mean. And it does exactly as
advertised, no more, no less. When building an application with Sinatra, you get to
pick and choose. DataMapper vs. ActiveRecord vs. Sequel? A single line in the Gemfile.
Not MVC? No problem. Custom directory structure? We wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s <strong>no magic</strong> in Sinatra (or just plain Rack, if that&#8217;s your fancy). It&#8217;s all
<strong>just code</strong>. And chances are you&#8217;ll have written or read a lot of it.
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress says code is poetry</a>, and I agree, but given that
Wordpress is written in PHP, I feel that with ruby&#8230; <em>code is art</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/checkthis.com/asset/4fca9c0855a70a00030025d7/4fca9c0855a70a00030025d7-medium.png" alt="Code is art" /></p>

<p>In the world of ruby, there happens to be another wonder called Sprockets. Sprockets
is what powers Rails&#8217; 3.1+ asset pipeline. And therein lies the problem.</p>

<p>Sprockets is an awesome tool, and adding it to a Rack application makes things even
sparklier than pink unicorns. But it&#8217;s relatively under-documented and Googling for
solutions returns Rails-related stuff 99% of the time. Annoying. That&#8217;s due to a little
something called sprockets-rails, which takes sprockets, adds magic, and transforms it
into the asset pipeline. Trying to use asset pipeline know-how with standalone Sprockets
is frustrating.</p>

<p>So how do you do it?</p>
