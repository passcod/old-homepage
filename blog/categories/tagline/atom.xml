    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been thinking about getting a new tagline recently. I don’t mean “Somewhat
of a geek, but more of a techie.” That’s fine, and I’m pretty happy about it. I
mean the stuff that comes after it, not on this blog, but <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod">on Twitter</a> and
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/231788/felix-saparelli">other</a> <a href="http://fictionaut.com/users/felix-saparelli">places</a> where a bio is necessary. Currently, that’s:</p>

<p><q>Makes the web, reads books, writes blurbs, admires fonts, critiques code.
Thinks &lt;3 looks like an ice-cream cone.</q></p>

<p>Obviously, for Twitter, it has to fit within 100 chars, and I have used longer
versions or addendi on sites which are less restricted. I consider this version
the ‘official’ one, though.</p>

<p>I’ve been delaying changing it, though, because I really want to include
something Mozilla-related, and I don’t think I’ve done nearly enough in any
Mozilla-related domain to justify putting something in what is essentially part
of my online identity. However, I've come to terms with it by accepting the
caveat I need to make that new one extensible.</p>

<p>I’ll probably use single words or one-unit terms separated with bullets (‘•’ or
U+2022 or ⌥ + 8) or interpuncts (‘·’ or U+00B7 or ⇧ + ⌥ + 9) depending on which
is best-looking in context and my mood at the time.</p>

<p>This definitely requires more reflexion, though.</p>
