    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It can’t be the romance. It’s above <em>Twilight</em>, but not quite <em>The Moor of
Venice</em>. It can’t be the historical value. I might not be an expert on the
years prior the <em>Civil War</em>, but I do consider myself reasonably educated, and
certainly enough to appreciate the more obvious inaccuracies. It can’t be the
suspense, of course. This is a grand tale, a <em>Tarantino</em>, where The Good Guys
Win, and of that little is left to doubt.</p>

<p>If it’s not either of these, then <em>what</em>, exactly, can it be which excited me
so that I, not once nor twice but thrice, almost stood up and really did laugh
out loud at the screen and with such a grin, what is it then which delighted
me so?</p>

<p>I attribute it to three things, because three is the magic number; beyond that
you’ll lose patience and your attention will waver, and beneath your thirst
won’t be quenched. The first thing is art, the second is art, and the third?
the third is music.</p>
